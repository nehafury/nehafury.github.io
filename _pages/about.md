[🚨 **Note**: I am recruiting PhD students, primarily for programs in computer science and electrical engineering.  Reach out if you're interested. 🚨]: #

Hello there 🙂
I am Ashwin – an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University double majoring in Computer Science and Neuroscience. I work as a researcher at Cleveland Clinic, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Professor [Carl Saab](https://www.saablab.com) on EEG Predictive Models . 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Neuroscience and AI Interpretability. I am invested in advancing mechanistic understanding of how LLM’s “Think”, and leveraging multimodal models to deepen our understanding of neurological phenomena.

As President of AI@CWRU and writer of [ashneurotech](https://ashwinsaraswatula.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile),  I’m passionate about delving deep into intricate and technical aspects of Artificial Intelligence!
